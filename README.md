# This is the code repository work for ratio-based random forest classifier for Baijiu quality evaluation.

## To simply used the classifier, please download this repository to your local disk.
## The following files are required:
    0.rawdata/
        datasheet.xlsx
        odor_threshold.xlsx
        odor_descripter.xlsx

## To run the code, use the following command:
python run_model.py -in [path of the datasheet.xlsx] -ot [path of the odor_threshold.xlsx] -od [path of the odor_descripter.xlsx]

### It may take few hours to few days to run the program based on the size of your dataset.
